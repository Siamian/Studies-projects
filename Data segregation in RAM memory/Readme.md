# Data segregation in RAM memory

# Brief
The purpose of this project is to design a device for organizing the results
long jumping.
The data comes to the device from the stroke length measurement system. 
An impulse is sent with the result of the jump
notation (Wr). The jump length is encoded with the BCD code.
